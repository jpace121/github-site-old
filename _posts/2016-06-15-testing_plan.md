I haven't forgotten about this project, but did get really busy working on
a series of important projects for grad school. My plan this weekend is
to get shaking on this project again. The first step will be to hook up
the solenoid circuit using the MOSFETs as shown in the circuit from the
last blog post. I'll be using the 5V power supply I grabbed from Sparkfun
a few months ago to test everything, if I forget to grab my variable supply
from school.

The next blog post will be a comparison between the different switching
methods in practice, and see how my projections of performance are.
