I went ahead a purchased a toy xylophone from WalMart today. I went
with the
[little tikes Tap-a-Tune Xylophone](http://www.littletikes.com/preschool-toddler/music/icat/toddlermusic/tap-a-tune-xylophone/invt/627767),
purchased from WalMart. Total cost (with tax) was $16.10.

My requirements for the xylophone were:

1. Inexpensive
2. 8 "keys" so that I could play a whole scale. (But not more than 8,
   because I don't want to have to purchase extra solenoids.)
   
I looked on Amazon for toy xylophones last night, and realized there
were lots of options which only really differed aesthetically. I really
wanted to go ahead and buy the thing so it was in front of me, so I decided
to see what I could grab locally. Luckily, WalMart had the Tap-a-Tune, which
met the requirements I listed above. I had two concerns that pushed me to
want to go ahead and get something. The first was that the mechanical design
is largely going to be dictated by the dimensions and layout of the
xylophone, so I can't do any of that without the xylophone.
I also know that personal projects that start as ideas have a bad habit of
stalling and then dieing if not started quickly, and I don't want this thing
to stall. For $16, I'm willing to accept the risk that I may have to buy
another one later, but can see positive progress now, reducing the
chance that the project dies.

My current plan is to remove the green base from the xylophone, leaving
the white support and the "keys" (I need to figure out what these are
really called.) I'll build a custom base out of wood, which will connect
to the support system for the solenoids. I'm also planning on putting LEDs
above each of the "keys" somewhere, to add the ability to give a cool
visual show as well. I'm thinking of making the LEDs independent of the
solenoids so even when the xylophone is not being used the LEDs can pulse, etc
and put on a show. Adafruit has some really nice LED drivers, so I'll probably
start there looking for inspiration.

Solenoid wise, I've found options at both Adafruit and Sparkfun which are
in my budget. Sparkfun's are driven by a 5V supply, which makes them
attractive, compared to the ones at Adafruit which needed a special
voltage input. Adafruit provided an example circuit to control their
solenoids from a microcontroller, which will save me a lot of head banging.

I think my next step is to learn more about the solenoids. I would like
to go ahead and order one that I can play with next weekend. I would really
like to find a breakout board to drive them if I can, but Adafruit's example
circuit is well within my comfort zone... I still have zero clue what
microcontroller I want to use, but I think I'm going to put that, and the
internet control part, off until I get everything else prototyped.
