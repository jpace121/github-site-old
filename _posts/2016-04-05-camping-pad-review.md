I've recently been given a [Coleman Self Inflating Camp Pad](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Self-Inflating-Camp-Attached-Pillow/dp/B00BF9IYO4) as a present.

It just came today, and I unboxed and tried it on the hardwood floors tonight.
I was super impressed with the automatic inflation. The only other inflatable
matress I've ever used was a big one, made for kids, with required a hair dryer
to get it full. The fact that all I had to do was open it was pretty nice.

I found it plenty comfy on the hardwood floor. I didn't feel the floor at all.
I liked the fact that it wasn't so thick that it bounced around when I turned
over. I don't think it will ever be better than a bed, but it definitely
will be nicer than laying on the ground directly.

Putting it back up wasn't too hard either. I liked the fact that it didn't
require any type of extra bag that I would have to keep track of.
