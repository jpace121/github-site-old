Why blog? For me it is mainly to become a better writer and communicator,
particularly when it comes to technical issues. (I'm also a little cocky,
and think that my opinion *must* be interesting to *someone* else.)

My current plan is to try to review some technical papers, as well as
different historical documents that I find interesting. I may also blog
about random other content. Hopefully, I'll knock out a post or two a
week.

For the blog, I've decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using Google Analytics
to count page views. (I need to figure out how to have Google Analytics
not count self views...) I'm currently using the default jekyll theme, and,
honestly, kind of like it, since it is so simple and clean looking. I am
game though to customize the theme at some point if I can tweak everything
into something better.

Before I chose to use jekyll, I also considered using blogger, as I had toyed
with that before. Ultimately, I went with jekyll because I like editing
text better with my custom emacs install than anything else. My only concern
with jekyll is the difficulty in organizing static files like pictures. My
current plan is to organize my '_assets' directory with dates, but we will see
how that goes...

Thanks,
