Hi! I'm still alive and working on "not work stuff" that I can blog about.
This winter break I did a bunch of work on the Xylophone project, which I will
write up sometime soon.

Today I want to talk about an idea for a tiny walking robot I've been thinking
about. I've been thinking about cool things I can do with the tiny ATtiny85,
and I love robots that use "non-standard" actuation techniques.

I've been thinking about buidling a small robot actuated by the same 5V
solenoids I'm using for the Xylophone. Two solenoids will be put on either
side of the robot's body. The solenoids would be angled down such that
they impact the ground at 45 degrees, and will push the robot along as
they hit the ground. The robot will slide along the ground, and the body
will need to be low friction. So the little solenoids can be used, the whole
robot will have to be super light, and could be potentially build with
card board, which is something I've also been thinking abotu being cool.

I'm pretty sure I've seen something like this in the literature before, but
I'm not sure where. It sounds cool, and I'll be looking at it. My next post
will include some sketches and math. I probably will wait until I'm done
with the Xylophone to get started.
