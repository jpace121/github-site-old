One of the more interesting alternative energy sources I've seen is algae.
Algae is grown, harvested, and treated to produce biodiesel, which can then
be used in generators, engines, etc. The $$CO_2$$ released when the fuel is
burned is $$CO_2$$ that was just recently removed from the atmosphere by the
algae when it was growing, tightening up the carbon cycle, particularly
compared to our current methods using oil[^Wikipedia]. Algae fuel is
also disturbs the food proccess less than other biodiesels, like corn and
soybeans, because it is not otherwise edible by humans and can be grown on
otherwise unarable land. What's keeping it from being more popular is pure
econonmics: it's too expensive to harvest and produce right now. This opens
the door to a traditional engineering challenge: making the production of
algae more economically efficient.

## Current Methods of Algae Production ##

The two general methods for growing are raceways and bioreactors. Raceways
are basically big open ponds that algae grows at the top of. In 1990,
the U.S. DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that open
racway ponds were the most efficient means of algae production[^biomassmag].
Unfortunately, open raceways suffere from contamination and effects due
to climate flunctuations (bioreactors are more expensive.)

# Limitations #
Light - only 5cm of surface to pond get enough light
Evaporation
Temperature Variations
