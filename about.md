This is the blog of James Pace.

I am a currently a Master's Student at Florida State University studying
Mechanical Engineering, with a focus in Controls and Robotics. I
work at the
[Center for Intelligent Systems, Controls, and Robotics](http://www.ciscor.org)
at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.

I'm interested in (in no particular order) mechatronics, robotics,
controls, machine learning, programming, industrial automation,
ham radio, and all sorts of cool hacks.
