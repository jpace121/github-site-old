This is the blog of jpace121, and will contain pretty much any random thought
I have.

I am a currently a Master's Student at a major state university studying
Mechanical Engineering, with a focus in Controls and Robotics. I'm interested
in (in no particular order) mechatronics, robotics, controls, artificial
intelligence, programming, industrial automation, and all sorts of cool
hacks.
