This is the blog of James Pace, and will contain pretty much any random thought
I have.

I am a currently a Master's Student at Florida State University studying
Mechanical Engineering, with a focus in Controls and Robotics.
I'm interested in (in no particular order) mechatronics, robotics,
controls, machine learning, programming, industrial automation,
ham radio, and all sorts of cool hacks.
